# Gear Protocol - Greeting Smart Contract in Rust

This repository contains the source code for a smart contract written in Rust that allows storing, reading, and writing a greeting message.
The smart contract is built on the Gear Protocol blockchain.

The contract has a default message that can be read by anyone, and a write method that allows changing the message. The contract also prints the address of the user who is making the change, along with the new message.
